REACT
The working flow of a react application.
The index.html file contains the id in the div element,The html in app.js file will be rendered in index.js using the id. 
In node module libraries it contains what is initialized when we start the run command the react-scripts and then the start.js file will be executed. The package.json file 
contains the react and react DOM Versions, scripts and what are the execution steps for the execution of application. 
HTML,CSS and Javascript are used to create the web app although React javascript library is preferred because in order to avoid the complications 
in coding and also to find where the code is reused ,we use Components to add multiple functionalities in a web page.
